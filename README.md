Is it the onion?

This site aims to determine whether a simple neural network model can differentiate between a real news headline or one generated by the genius minds at theonion.com. 

Front end:
A text box where a user can input a headline. A button to submit (also responds to carriage return).

Back end:
A trained model that will take the input and return a true/false value whether the headline is a fake headline or not, and its confidence level.

Security:
We will not be hosting our data set or API keys on the cloud. Only the model and the code for the front-end will be present.

This app will be containerized TBD
This app will be hosted on a cloud service here - TBD
